# Project 5 
 Public API Requests

I am going for "Meets Expectations"

This project includes the following.

API Usage
12 random users are pulled from the API. New random employee information displays each time the page refreshes.

User Directory
The directory displays 12 users from the Random User API. It includes the following for each user, Employee Image, First and Last Name, Email, City or location.

Modal Window
Modal window displays at least the following details:

Employee image, Name, Email, City or location, Cell Number, Detailed Address, including street name and number, state or country, and post code. There is a way to close the modal window.

Structure, style and Css
The major elements of the directory and modal window are in place and roughly match the mockups. Note: Modal window address can have the state's full name, rather than the two letter state code.
